                       Bootcamp one 
                 subject : React basic concepts 

00.what is react ? 
Ans: React is an efficient, declarative, and flexible open-source JavaScript library for building simple, fast, and scalable frontends of web application.

01. Differentiate between Real DOM and Virtual DOM.?
 
Ans: :Real dom is the  browser’s  representation of  HTML   structures.when user  interacts with website, real dom reflects it and updated html.

 Virtual  dom is an abstraction of real dom and lightweight copy of real dom.when user change any state,virtual dom updates only changable part by diffing algorithm .it has another name reconsilation..


Real dom : every  update requires the browser to recalculate the entire document layout.virtual dom allows for faster updates and improved performance.
	
Virtual DOM is highly flexible and can be used with any programming language. Real DOM is tightly coupled with the browser and can only be manipulated using JavaScript.



02. List some of the major advantages of React  js 
Ans:
i)	 Flexibility due to modular structure
ii)	   Complex app can run high performance for virtual Dom and server side rendering 
iii)	 to learn react you need have basic knowledge of javascript
iv)	Deploying React is fairly easy to accomplish if you have some basic knowledge of JavaScript.
v)	It has reuseable components that saves time  and removes same code repitation 

03)Limitation of React js 

i)	Lack of proper documentation
ii)	Developer speed 
iii)	Jsx complexity
iv)	Problem with SEO
v)	Steep learnig curve: without good knowledge of javascript you can not understand properly react.Virtual dom, jsx syntax, state management of react is painfull,harder concenpt for new  developer
vi)	Boilerplate code: to start new project you need to significant amount of set up and need configuration.set up project structure,installing dependencies,configuration tools such as babel, webpack are count in Boilerplate code.

 04) Why React is best choice ? 
   Ans: 
i)	Easy to learn 
ii)	It helps to build user interface
iii)	Allows writing custome code
iv)	Fast rendering
v)	SEO friendly
vi)	Strong community support
vii)	Available extension

               01.What is JSX, and how does it work? 
	       
Ans:Jsx means javascript XML that is a syntax extension of javascript and valid javascript code .it is a javascript power,  and dynamic value added in jsx file.

Browers does not understand Jsx code . .Babel is a transpiler of js .Jsx code transpile  into javascript code by Babel.then browser understand jsx code .

    02. What are React hooks? Explain the most common React  hooks and their usage. ?
    
    Ans:Hooks are simple javascript function that allow functional component to use state.It can be statefull and manage side effect.

                      Most common in react hooks....

   i)useState: manage state and contains two element.one is     current value and other is  update value that is function.
   
   ii) useEffect:it manage side effect like API call, subscription and more.
   
  iii) useContext:  it retruns a current value from a context
  
  iv) useReducer: it is a alternative of useState hook.it helps with complex state management
  
  v)UseRef:  Returns a ref with current property.

03) Why do you prefer using functional components?
4) 
   Ans: Functional components are simple javascript function that takes a props as an argument and return  a react element to be rendered .
   

    Prefer using functional components
i)	It is easy to learn and code clean & readable
ii)	No require for constructor method
iii)	No concern about “this” keyword
iv)	It is simple than class component
v)	Debugging and testing easier
vi)	It is reuseabl
